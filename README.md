RAG system over cs.AI research papers, focusing on hallucination analysis and citation faithfulness.


# Reliable RAG for Scientific Literature (arXiv cs.AI)

This project builds and evaluates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system
for answering questions over scientific papers from the arXiv cs.AI category.

Focus areas:
- Hallucination analysis
- Citation faithfulness
- Uncertainty estimation in LLM outputs

The goal is to engineer a reliable, reproducible RAG pipeline suitable for
scientific and technical domains.
